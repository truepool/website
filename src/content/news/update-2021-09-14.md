After the updating of our [Chia Docker image to 1.2.6](https://github.com/truepool/chia-docker/releases/tag/v1.2.6_1), we have now also added the [ChiaDog](https://github.com/martomi/chiadog/) program to our included applications. ChiaDog provides a nice interface for monitoring and alerting of your Chia Farmers / Harvesters, which we expect many farmers will want to incorporate.

Happy Farming and good luck!
