TruePool Farmers,

Some updates for our farming community today:

First, we are pleased to make available a new feature to send you email warnings should your local farmer stop sending partials to the pool. This can be enabled by setting your email address on the [LeaderBoard name configuration](https://truepool.io/kb/set-friendly-leaderboard-name) and clicking the checkbox to opt-in for email warnings. We encourage all farmers who aren't actively using monitoring software to enable this functionality as soon as possible.

Second, we are pleased to give an update on our ongoing [Block Bounty Program](https://truepool.io/news/update-2021-09-28). As of 10/5, all bounties have been paid to the lucky block winners, and we're excited to keep those extra XCH rewards flowing through the end of the year. If you haven't joined TruePool yet, this is a great chance to get on-board!
