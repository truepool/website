What a wild end to August! We wrapped up the month with a bang, in addition to passing 7PiB space, we also won 3 blocks within an hour which has made TruePool the [luckiest pool in the world](https://chiapool.directory/). The hot streak caught the attention of our friends over at [TheChiaPlot.net](https://thechiaplot.net/), who wrote a fantastic article about the [experience of farming with a small pool.](https://thechiaplot.net/2021/09/01/is-joining-a-smaller-chia-pool-a-mistake/)

Additionally we've been continuing to update our [Docker Images](https://truepool.io/kb/truepool-docker-image) which now includes Chia 1.2.5, Farmr.net 1.7.5.6 and more.

As always, we're happy to welcome new farmers and have built what we'd argue is one of the best Chia Pooling communities in the world. If you haven't yet, join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/hWwAfGFyBz) and we'll be seeing you on the farm!
