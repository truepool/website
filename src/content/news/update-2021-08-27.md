TruePool Farmers,

Some quick updates as we wrap up a busy August!

- [Docker Image Updated](https://truepool.io/kb/truepool-docker-image)! Includes Chia 1.2.4, Farmr.net 1.7.5, latest MadMax and other fixes!
- [Feature Roadmaps](https://truepool.io/kb/feature-roadmap) - See what features are coming to TruePool, and submit your own via [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hWwAfGFyBz)!

We on the TruePool operators team are proud to have maintained such fantastic stability from launch until now. TruePool may be small, but we're growing and its one of the few pools where you will not have to worry about your operators scamming you by inflating netspace or injecting fake farmers to skim rewards off the back of your hard farming efforts. Keep on farming, and we'll be here to help make the journey fun and profitable.
