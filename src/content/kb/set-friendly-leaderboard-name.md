## How to create a friendly name for your launcher id on the Leaderboard?

The [Farmers leaderboard](https://truepool.io/farmers) is a great place to compare your status and resources with other members of TruePool.

Unfortunately, it only contains your launcher ID and is hard to identify whom is who.

We now have a tool that will allow you to set a *friendly* name for your ID.

Once you look up your launcher ID follow these steps:

### From the command line:

1. Issue the command `chia plotnft get_login_link -l <launcher_id>`
2. Open the link returned in your browser
3. Set the *friendly name* you wish to use and submit. 

### From the Chia UI:

1. Under Plots -> 3 dot menu -> View pool login link 
2. Open the link returned in your browser
3. Set the *friendly name* you wish to use and submit. 

Please keep the name clean and friendly or it may be removed.  
No foul language, insults, or similar!

## Enjoy!
