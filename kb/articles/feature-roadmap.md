# TruePool Feature Roadmap

#### Last updated: 08-27-2021


While the TruePool.io website is [open source](https://github.com/truepool/website), its backend component is not.
This roadmap should provide transparency about upcoming features.


## Current priorities

* **PPLNS _(in-progress)_**
* **Minimum payout**
* **Node caching**

### Next in queue

* Coinrecord model updates
* Farmer achievement system
* Trophies on Leaderboard - (Won a block in last 30 days, most space added in 24 hours, etc)

Feature priorities are open to discussion! Drop a line on the [TruePool.io Discord](https://discord.com/invite/hWwAfGFyBz). 

## Happy farming!
